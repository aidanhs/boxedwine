BoxedWine [options] Program

example:

BoxedWine -root c:\root -m 64 /bin/wine notepad

This will look for a file system in root, configure 64MB of emulated RAM and run "/bin/wine" in the file system with an argument of notepad

BoxedWine -root c:\root -zip wine.zip /bin/wine notepad

This will load the file system from wine.zip and write the changes to c:\root

* options

-gensrc : This is used for ahead of time (AOT) compiling and requires the source to be build with GENERATE_SOURCE.  With this enabled the user can run the program, then compile the output back into the program for a performance boost.  Currently I don't recommend using this, it should be considered experimental and the out put will not be compatible with future versions of BoxedWine.

-m XX : How many megabytes the emulated RAM will have.  The default is 64

-nosound : Disable /dev/dsp which will disable sound

-resolution WxH : Initial emulated screen size.  Default is 800x600.  This is usual for apps/games that aren't full screen and won't change the screen size themselves.

-root path : Path to the file system the emulated linux environment will used

-uid X : Only useful if you want the emulated enviroment to report that it is root.  Useful if an app requires root privledges.  In that case set the uid to 0.

-w path : Initial working directory, default is /home/username.  This path needs to reference a path in the emulated file system.

-zip path : This will load the file system from the zip file.  Use -root option for the location where new files can be created.
