TODO
1) Get XOrg mouse to work without Option "UseSIGIO" "False"

Need to research

1) How to use OpenGL with a native loader (might need to compile a custom opengl lib or might need to go back to an emulated loader)
2) consider using lighter weight X11 implementations like nanoX
3) Research using less memory for the MMU (per process), perhaps a 2 index approach like the new JPC
4) Add emscriptem as a target to visual studio 2010
5) add MMX instructions
6) sound
