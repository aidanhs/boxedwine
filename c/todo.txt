CURRENT
1) Almost done: remove X11 dependency by implementing a new version of winex11.drv
2) Almost done: 16-bit code (win16 in wine), currently it hangs early in an app while waiting for input

FUTURE
1) Find a spec or unit test for mmap, I think I have a bug in my implementation, older versions of Wine don't work with it.
2) Get emscripten with webgl working, perhaps with glshim
3) tcp sockets
4) BUG: Age of Empires will cause XOrg to stop responding when entering a user name for a new game
5) Research using less memory for the MMU (per process), perhaps a 2 index approach like the new JPC
6) add MMX instructions
7) oss sound is done, researching making alsa work with it, or implement oss v4
8) MMUless with ahead of time compiling
