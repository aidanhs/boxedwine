Current
1) Continue to get more games to work.

Future: Not in any particular order

1) Find an alternative to for setjmp/longjmp, this really slows things down on Emscripten, but games like SimTower need it
2) Get OpenGL to work on Windows
3) Get emscripten with webgl working, perhaps with glshim
4) tcp sockets
5) Research using less memory for the MMU (per process), perhaps a 2 index approach like the new JPC.  Currently is uses 20MB per process.
6) add MMX instructions
7) Implemented oss v4, but it can sound scratchy at times, like the intro to Diablo
8) MMUless with ahead of time compiling (MMUless has been put on hold, I just don't think it will be very compatible with most games)
9) On x86 platforms, research a dynamic recompiler, like DosBox or maybe something more ambitious like VirtualBox
