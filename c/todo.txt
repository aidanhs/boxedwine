Need to Code

  To get a console app running and output to stdout
    1) file system emulation
    2) kernel sys calls
    3) elf classes do load ld into memory

  To get WINE to run
    1) SDL stuff (video, mouse, keyboard)
    2) frame buffer, mouse and keyboard dev nodes

Need to research

1) How to use OpenGL with a native loader (might need to compile a custom opengl lib or might need to go back to an emulated loader)
2) consider using lighter weight X11 implementations like nanoX
3) Research using less memory for the MMU (per process), perhaps a 2 index approach like the new JPC
4) Add emscriptem as a target to visual studio 2010
5) make files for other platforms
6) add MMX instructions
