SDL2             This will cause SDL2 to be used instead of SDL1.  You will need to link to the correct libraries.
UNALIGNED_MEMORY This is necessary if the host isn't little endian, necessary for emscripten

To compile, you need one and only one of the follow 3 flags

MESA Mesa        off screen buffer will be used to render OpenGL.
BOXEDWINE_ES     SDL OpenGL ES code will be used.  OpenGL calls will be translated to ES.
BOXEDWINE_SDL    SDL OpenGL context will be used

buildjs.sh/shell.html
This build script is used to build an emscripten target.  A folder named root containing the linux filesystem must exist in the current directory.
The contents of the root directory is gzipped up and merged into the emscripten build.

settings:
By default uploading/downloading occurs inside the directory /root/home/username/.wine/drive_c/files/.
It is possible to modify this by appending a ?dir=somedir to the url, else change the dirPrefix in shell.html

buildjsfs.sh/shellfs.sh
This build script integrates the browserfs library [https://github.com/jvilk/BrowserFS].
It introduces a writeable file store for the /home directory. By default dropbox integration is set.
Alternatively browser local storage can be used.  A third option is memory which effectively imitates what the buildjs.sf provides.
Again the root directory is zipped, but this time with zip.  Due to the slow unzipping process do not use a large filesystem
(Use the Reduce util in the java source tree if needed).

settings:
var dirPrefix  - sets the directory where the upload/download functionality operates.
var storageMode - can be either DROPBOX, LOCAL_STORAGE or MEMORY

notes on modes:
DROPBOX - OAuth dance provided via dropbox.js library [https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js].
Because of this boxedwine must be served from a web server when using this option.
Also must set DROPBOX_APP_KEY and RECEIVE_URL (absolute path) inside the html.
Make remember to also set the receive_url in your dropbox app console.
LOCAL_STORAGE - browsers are crap at storage (add to the long list of other things),
may not be  available and even if it is there are limits depending on browser, os and position of the zodiac.
MEMORY - but why? just like using buildjs.sh/shell.html but slower.

other dials/tweaks for emscripten build files.
see var Module inside the html file.  Can alter memory allocation and other bits and pieces.
