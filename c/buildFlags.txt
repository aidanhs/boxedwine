SDL2             This will cause SDL2 to be used instead of SDL1.  You will need to link to the correct libraries.
UNALIGNED_MEMORY This is necessary if the host isn't little endian, necessary for emscripten
USE_MMU          This emulates x86 and is more compatible but slower.  Without this, the linux binaries that run need to be compiled to load at any address.  Also fork will need to be replaced with vfork

To compile, you need one and only one of the follow 3 flags

MESA Mesa        off screen buffer will be used to render OpenGL.
BOXEDWINE_ES     SDL OpenGL ES code will be used.  OpenGL calls will be translated to ES.
BOXEDWINE_SDL    SDL OpenGL context will be used

buildjs*.sh/shell.html
This build script is used to build an emscripten target.  A folder named root containing the linux filesystem must exist in the current directory.
The contents of the root directory is gzipped up and merged into the emscripten build.

settings:
By default uploading/downloading occurs inside the directory /root/home/username/files/.
It is possible to modify this by appending a ?dir=somedir to the url, else change HOME_DIRECTORY in shell.html
also possible to change memory allocated to boxedwine via DEFAULT_MEMORY_ALLOCATION_MB or ?m=32 on url. Default is 64
Other configuration options:
AUTO_RUN - indicates if start button is shown. default false
ALLOW_PARAM_OVERRIDE_FROM_URL - indicates if url can be appended with params as above for dir & m.

buildjsfs.sh/shellfs.sh
This build script integrates the browserfs library [https://github.com/jvilk/BrowserFS].
It introduces a writeable file store for the HOME_DIRECTORY directory. 
3 options for setting variable storageMode:
- STORAGE_DROPBOX
- STORAGE_LOCAL_STORAGE
- STORAGE_MEMORY (default - which means readonly)

notes on modes:
DROPBOX - OAuth dance provided via dropbox.js library [https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js].
Because of this boxedwine must be served from a web server when using this option.
Also must set DROPBOX_APP_KEY and RECEIVE_URL (absolute path) inside the html.
Make remember to also set the receive_url in your dropbox app console.
LOCAL_STORAGE - browsers are crap at storage (add to the long list of other things),
may not be  available and even if it is there are limits depending on browser, os and position of the zodiac.
MEMORY - likely to be slower then using the buildjsmem_*.sh version. More noticeable for larger file system images.

other dials/tweaks for emscripten build files.
see var Module inside the html file.
